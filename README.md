# SpanReporter for Java
SpanReporter forward to backend Tracer and reports trace into Reporter.

```java
public interface Reporter {
    void start(long timestampMicroseconds, SpanR span);
    void finish(long timestampMicroseconds, SpanR span);
    void log(long timestampMicroseconds, SpanR span, Map<String, ?> event);
}
```
## Use Case

* As zero server tracer.
    * To use OpenTracing API, before selection and deployment of your Server Tracer.
    * To log with spanId, context, without using MDC.
* To add log support to some server tracer that doesn't support `.log(...)`
* To report some metrics (eg. histogram of span)

## Slf4jReporter

* Message is reported as structured message (json)
* Message at start and at finish is logged with level TRACE

# Usage

## Application intialization

* Add dependency (format depends of your build tool)
```
"io.opentracing.contrib" % "span-reporter" % "${span-reporter.version}"
```
* Instantiate the TracerR (For using DI, you can take inspiration from [Guice samples](./src/test/java/io/opentracing/contrib/di)
):
```java
tracer = ... // if not backend tracer use NoopTracerFactory.create()
tracer = new TracerR(tracer, new Slf4jReporter(LoggerFactory.getLogger("tracer")));
```
* Setup your logger (example below use logback, but any slf4j compatible logger should work)
    * add dependencies
    ```
    "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.1.3"
    ```
    * configure le logger (simplest)
    ```xml
    <logger name="tracer" level="TRACE"/>
    ```

## Custom Reporter(s)

Developer can provide its own [Reporter](./src/main/java/opentracing/contrib/reporter/Reporter.java):
* to report log in an other log system
* to report log in an other format
* to report metrics about span/operation (histogram, nb calls, duration, ...)

To report to several Reporters at once, you can use the CompositeReporter:
```java
Tracer tracer = ...
tracer = new TracerR(tracer, new CompositeReporter(
    new Slf4jReporter(LoggerFactory.getLogger("tracer")),
    new DropwizardMetricsReporter(...)
));
```

## Use as a Logging Tracer

To use the java span reporter as a simple Logging Tracer via the
[TracerResolver](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-tracerresolver), just add the following dependency
(format depends of your build tool):

```
"io.opentracing.contrib" % "span-reporter-resolver" % "${span-reporter.version}"
```
